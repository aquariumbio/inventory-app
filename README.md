# Inventory prototype (Rails)

Based on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/ruby-rails

This is one of two prototypes for a new inventory app. The schema is roughly correct, but the overall architecture of https://github.com/aquariumbio/inventory-prototype-react is preferred.
